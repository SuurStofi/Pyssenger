Features:

A new Python Messenger that has Public and Private keys encryption. 

The main feature is that you can setup a password on your keys folder, so then they could be encrypted in zip folder.

Zip folder encryption would encode your code in Base64 and turn it into hash, so it would be impossible to bruteforce access.

Login/Signup page encrypted

Private/Public Channels creation
